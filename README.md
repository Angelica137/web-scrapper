# Scrappy

A web-scrapper built with Python

As part of a larger ongoing project, I need to build a web scrapper to collect data, present it to the user in a usable format and make it possible to manipulate the data.

I am working on this smaller project to learn how we can best approach this task in our larger prject at B & D.
